hi
this viewing using diff
is helpful
as we can compare between 
2 versions of a file
If the older version was better, 
we can switch back 
to it.
This gives us an opportunty
to experiment with stuff
and later we can reflect.

But note that using diff data should not be in one line as longer lines are not preffered here. Because here it will just tell us where error exists and then we will have to look throug everything on our own

Yes it will make you an effecient programmar, as version control will help you move anywhere in the past and you can reach any state of your file
Version Control is provided by many services like google docs, dropbox and wikipedia

commands
git log: git log displays all the commits which have occured since beginning, which means it displays the complete hhistory
its shows the following:
commit id
date 
author
message

git diff: it shows the difference between 2 commits by displaying additions using + sign and deletions using - sign

How version control makes me more confident about making changes?
Yes Ia completely agree that version control makes me more and more confident about making changes in my project as it gives me the flexibility to move back and forth in case I have made any change to my code or if after modification I bug is generated. So version control acts as a support for such situations. It reallly gets our back.

I have set up my workspace for ease of user.
In setting up workspace, I configured the following
- look and feel of bash
- auto completion files
- editor default sublime
- some other commands
So now i can use git for my google scripts, javascripts and other cloud platform and API and android projects
It gives me flexibility to experiment and to move forward and backward
Thanks git! your the best

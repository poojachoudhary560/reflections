What happens when you initialize a repository? why do you need to do it?
A repository is always created in a directory. The directory folder may contain many other sub-folders.
We initilaze a repository using git init - This command makes the directory into a repository
We initialize a repository s that we can save various versions of the projects we have. We cannot do that in a folder. We need a repository to do that

When repository is initialized, it do not have any commits

Staging area
working directory contains files
when we create a repository in that directory, initially the repository cntains no files which are present in working directory
Then you yourself would have to commit these files in working directory to repository
But as git allows you this flexibility to decide which files you want to commit, thus this introduces the concept of staging area
Only those files which you add to the staging area, will get commited.
You add these files using 
git add filename
if by mistake you add a wrong file, you can use git reset
Thus staging area is different from working directory as working dir is just a folder with all files
Repository contains all files which have been committed
Staging area is a place in between both of them and helps you add files from working dir to repository
